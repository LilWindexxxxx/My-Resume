    <h2>Skills</h2>

            <h3>Instruction</h3>
            <p>I have a craving to be able to learn more, not because I need a career or someone needs a worker, but because I find web development intriguing and complex and it has opened my mind to so many different things I can create!</p>

        <li>
            <h3>Aplomb</h3>
            <p>Pressure makes me who I am, I can never not become better at what I do. Pressure puts my mind into a state where nothing else matters and I feel as though every emotion runs dry and the only thing I can think of is what's in front of me. This poise of mine is what makes me perform very well under pressure. </p>
